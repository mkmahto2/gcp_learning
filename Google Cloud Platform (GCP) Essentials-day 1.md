## **🧭 What is a GCP Project?**

**A GCP (Google Cloud Platform) Project is the main container for all your cloud resources (like VMs, databases, storage, APIs, etc.).**  
 **Everything you do in GCP happens inside a project.**

## **🧱 Key Concepts of a GCP Project**

| Concept | Description | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Project ID** | **Unique identifier for the project (auto-generated or custom).** | **my-sample-project-12345** |
| **Project Name** | **Friendly display name (can change anytime).** | **Student Management System** |
| **Project Number** | **Internal numeric ID (fixed).** | **987654321098** |
| **Billing Account** | **Links your project to payment (for paid services).** | **Linked to your credit card or organization account.** |
| **APIs & Services** | **Each GCP feature (like Compute Engine, BigQuery) must be enabled per project.** | **Enable Compute Engine API for VMs.** |
| **IAM (Identity & Access Management)** | **Controls who can access or modify resources.** | **Admin, Developer, Viewer roles.** |
| **Service Accounts** | **Special accounts for apps/services to access resources securely.** | **Used by a web app to read from Cloud Storage.** |

## **⚙️ How GCP Projects Work**

1. **Create a project → It becomes your workspace.**

2. **Enable services you need (e.g., Storage, Compute Engine).**

3. **Assign permissions to users or service accounts.**

4. **Add resources (VMs, databases, APIs, etc.).**

5. **Monitor & manage costs via billing and budgets.**  
   

## **🌍 Uses of GCP Projects**

| Use Case | GCP Services Commonly Used |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Web Hosting / Apps** | **Compute Engine, App Engine, Cloud Run, Firebase Hosting** |
| **Data Storage & Backup** | **Cloud Storage, Bigtable, Filestore** |
| **Machine Learning & AI** | **Vertex AI, TensorFlow, AI APIs (Vision, Speech, NLP)** |
| **Data Analytics** | **BigQuery, Dataflow, Dataproc** |
| **Networking / Cloud Infrastructure** | **VPC, Cloud DNS, Load Balancing, Cloud Armor** |
| **DevOps & CI/CD** | **Cloud Build, Artifact Registry, Cloud Source Repositories** |
| **IoT Applications** | **IoT Core, Pub/Sub, Cloud Functions** |
| **Serverless Development** | **Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, Firestore** |

## **🔐 Benefits of Using GCP Projects**

**✅ Separation of environments — keep dev, test, and prod separate**  
 **✅ Better access control — assign IAM roles per project**  
 **✅ Cost tracking — see cost per project or team**  
 **✅ Security & Compliance — audit logs, policies, and encryption**  
 **✅ Scalability — easily add more services/resources when needed**

## **🧩 Example Structure (Real Use Case)**

**Project: “Student Management System”**

* **Compute Engine: hosts the backend API**

* **Cloud SQL: stores student data**

* **Cloud Storage: stores student photos and PDFs**

* **IAM Roles:**

  * **Admin: full control**

  * **Teacher: read/write student data**

  * **Viewer: read-only access**

* **Billing: tracks monthly cost**

* **Monitoring: Cloud Monitoring & Logs Explorer**

**🧠 Best Practices**

1. **Use separate projects for Dev, Test, and Production.**

2. **Assign least privilege IAM roles (avoid “Owner” for all).**

3. **Set up budgets and alerts to monitor spending.**

4. **Enable required APIs only (for security).**

5. **Use labels to organize resources by team or purpose.**

**🎯 Purpose of a Budget in GCP**

A **budget** helps you **monitor and control your spending** on GCP resources.  
 It allows you to:

* Set **spending limits** (monthly, quarterly, or yearly)

* Get **email alerts** when spending crosses thresholds

* Avoid **unexpected high bills**  
  
## 
## 

## **⚙️ Steps to Create a Budget in GCP**

### **🧩 Step 1: Open the Google Cloud Console**

* Go to **console.cloud.google.com**

* Sign in with your Google account.

### **📁 Step 2: Select Your Project**

* On the top navigation bar, choose the **project** you want to set a budget for.

* (Each project has its own billing account and cost tracking.)

### **💳 Step 3: Go to Billing Section**

* In the left sidebar, click **☰ Menu → Billing**

* Choose the **Billing Account** linked to your project.

### **📊 Step 4: Create a Budget**

* Under **Billing**, select **Budgets & alerts**

* Click **➕ CREATE BUDGET**

### **🧾 Step 5: Define Budget Scope**

Choose what the budget applies to:

* **Entire billing account** (all projects)

* **A specific project**

* **Specific services or labels**

➡ Example:  
 You can budget **only for Compute Engine** or for the **entire project**.

### **💰 Step 6: Set Budget Amount**

Choose your **budget type**:

1. **Fixed amount** — You define a specific amount (e.g., ₹1,000/month)

2. **Last month’s spend** — Automatically uses your previous month’s total.

3. **Specified percentage** — e.g., 110% of last month’s spend.

### **📩 Step 7: Set Budget Alerts**

Add **alert thresholds** (percentages of your budget).  
 You can get email alerts when spending crosses those limits.

Example:

* 50% alert → Early warning

* 90% alert → Almost full

* 100% alert → Budget reached

📬 Alerts are sent to:

* Billing account administrators

* Users you add manually (emails)

### **📈 Step 8: (Optional) Connect to Pub/Sub**

If you want **automated responses** (like shutting down VMs when budget exceeds),  
 you can publish alerts to a **Pub/Sub topic**, and trigger **Cloud Functions**.

### **✅ Step 9: Review and Create**

* Review all settings

* Click **Create Budget**

Your budget is now active\! 🎉  
 You’ll start receiving alerts based on your usage.

## **🧠 Example:**

| Item | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| Project | Student Management System |
| Budget Type | Fixed |
| Amount | ₹2,000 per month |
| Alerts | 50%, 90%, 100% |
| Alert Recipient | admin@example.com |

## **💡 Tips**

* Create **separate budgets** for different projects or teams.

* Review **billing reports** regularly to identify cost spikes.

* Use **Labels** (like env=dev, team=network) to track spending by environment.

## **☁️ What is Cloud IAM?**

**Cloud IAM (Identity and Access Management)** is a **security service** in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that lets you **control who (identity)** has **what access (role/permission)** to **which resource**.

💡 **Simple Meaning:**  
 IAM \= *Who can do what on which resource.*

## **🔑 Purpose of Cloud IAM**

* Manage **user access** to GCP resources.

* Assign **roles and permissions** securely.

* Maintain **least privilege** (give only what’s necessary).

* Ensure **audit and compliance** with organization rules.

## 

## 

## **🧩 Main Components of IAM**

| Component | Description | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Identity** | The entity that requests access (user, group, service account, etc.) | user:mukesh@gmail.com |
| **Resource** | The GCP object you want to protect | VM instance, Storage bucket |
| **Role** | Collection of permissions | roles/viewer, roles/editor |
| **Policy** | Set of bindings (who gets what role on which resource) | IAM policy for a project |
| **Binding** | Connects members (identities) to roles | Mukesh → Viewer role on Project |

## **🧠 How IAM Works (In Simple Terms)**

1. **User or service** tries to perform an action (e.g., start a VM).

2. GCP checks the **IAM policy** on that resource.

3. If the user’s **role** has that permission → ✅ access granted.

4. If not → ❌ access denied.

## **👥 Types of Identities**

| Identity Type | Description | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Google Account** | Personal user account | user@gmail.com |
| **Service Account** | For apps or VMs to access resources securely | myapp@appspot.gserviceaccount.com |
| **Google Group** | Group of users (for easier management) | dev-team@company.com |
| **Cloud Identity / Workspace** | Organizational user accounts | user@company.com |
| **AllAuthenticatedUsers** | Any signed-in user | (used in public apps) |

## 

## **🧾 Types of IAM Roles**

| Type | Description | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Primitive Roles** | Basic roles applied at project level | Viewer, Editor, Owner |
| **Predefined Roles** | Specific roles for GCP services | roles/compute.admin, roles/storage.objectViewer |
| **Custom Roles** | User-defined roles with selected permissions | roles/custom.networkMonitor |

### **🔹 Primitive Roles**

| Role | Access Level | Permissions |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Viewer | Read-only | Can view resources only |
| Editor | Modify resources | Can read/write but not manage IAM |
| Owner | Full control | Can manage everything including IAM |

### **🔹 Predefined Roles (Examples)**

| Service | Role | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Compute Engine | roles/compute.admin | Full access to VM instances |
| Cloud Storage | roles/storage.objectAdmin | Manage bucket objects |
| BigQuery | roles/bigquery.dataViewer | View datasets and tables |

### **🔹 Custom Roles**

* Created when predefined roles give too many or too few permissions.

* You choose only the permissions needed.

* Useful for **least privilege principle**.

## 

## **🏗️ IAM Hierarchy (Inheritance)**

IAM policies apply **hierarchically**:

**Organization → Folder → Project → Resource**

➡ Permissions at higher levels are **inherited** by lower levels.

Example:  
 If a user has “Viewer” role at the **Project** level,  
 they automatically get read access to **all resources** inside that project.

## **🔐 Best Practices**

✅ Follow **least privilege principle** — only necessary access.  
 ✅ Use **groups** instead of adding many users individually.  
 ✅ Use **service accounts** for automation.  
 ✅ Regularly **review IAM policies**.  
 ✅ Avoid using **Owner** role broadly.  
 ✅ Enable **Audit Logs** to monitor access.

## **📊 Real-World Example**

**Project:** student-management-system

* admin@school.com → **Owner**

* teacher@school.com → **Editor**

* viewer@school.com → **Viewer**

* app-service@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com → **Service Account User**

## **🧩 Command-Line Example (gcloud)**

\# View IAM policy for a project  
gcloud projects get-iam-policy my-project-id

\# Add a new user with viewer role  
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding my-project-id \\  
  \--member="user:mukesh@gmail.com" \\  
  \--role="roles/viewer"

## **📊 What is a Quota in GCP?**

A **quota** in Google Cloud Platform is a **limit** that Google sets on how much of a particular resource or service you can use.

💡 **Simple meaning:**  
 A **quota** prevents overuse of GCP resources — both to protect you from unexpected bills and to protect Google’s systems from abuse.

## **🎯 Purpose of Quotas**

1. **Prevent accidental overuse** of resources (e.g., too many VMs).

2. **Ensure fair resource sharing** among all users.

3. **Control cost and resource usage** for each project.

4. **Maintain system stability and performance.**

## **🧩 Types of Quotas**

| Type | Description | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Rate Quotas** | Limit how many API requests can be made per second or minute. | Cloud Storage API → 1000 requests/min |
| **Resource Quotas** | Limit the number of resources you can create in a project or region. | 24 CPU cores per region, 50 VMs per project |

## 

## 

## 

## 

## **🏗️ Examples of Common Quotas in GCP**

| GCP Service | Example Quota | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Compute Engine** | CPUs per region | Limit how many virtual CPUs you can use. |
| **Cloud Storage** | Buckets per project | Maximum number of buckets allowed. |
| **BigQuery** | API requests per day | Controls how many queries you can run daily. |
| **Cloud Functions** | Function invocations per 100 seconds | Prevents overuse of serverless functions. |
| **Pub/Sub** | Messages per minute | Limits publishing and subscribing rates. |

---

## **🧠 Quota vs Limit**

| Feature | Quota | Limit |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Definition** | Adjustable usage restriction | Fixed maximum system restriction |
| **Can it be increased?** | ✅ Yes (request via console) | ❌ No |
| **Example** | 24 CPUs per region | Max 256 CPUs per VM (cannot exceed) |

## 

## **⚙️ How to View Quotas**

### **🖥️ From Cloud Console**

1. Go to **console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas**

2. Select your **project**.

3. Use filters to see:

   * By **service** (e.g., Compute Engine)

   * By **region**

4. You’ll see columns:

   * Metric (type of quota)

   * Limit (maximum allowed)

   * Usage (current usage)

   * Limit type (regional/global)

## **📈 How to Increase Quota**

If you hit a quota limit, you can **request an increase**:

### **🪜 Steps:**

1. Go to **IAM & Admin → Quotas** in Cloud Console.

2. Select the quota(s) you want to increase.

3. Click **Edit Quotas → Request Quota Increase**.

4. Fill out:

   * **New limit** you want

   * **Region**

   * **Business reason**

5. Google Support reviews and approves (usually within 1–2 days).

💡 *Note:* You need **Billing enabled** and **Owner/Editor role** to request increases.

## **🔐 Best Practices for Managing Quotas**

✅ Monitor quotas regularly in the **Cloud Console**.  
 ✅ Set up **alerts** in Cloud Monitoring for nearing limits.  
 ✅ Request **increases early** for upcoming workloads.  
 ✅ Use **labels** to track which projects use more resources.  
 ✅ Automate checks via the **Service Usage API**.

## **🧾 Command-Line Examples (gcloud)**

\# List all quotas for a project

gcloud compute regions describe asia-south1

\# Check quota usage for a specific service

gcloud services quotas list \--service=compute.googleapis.com

\# Request quota increase (link provided by console)

## **🧩 Real-Life Example**

**Project:** “Web Hosting Project”

* **Compute Engine CPUs (per region):** 24 used out of 24 → 🚫 cannot create new VMs.

* **Solution:** Request quota increase to 48 CPUs in the same region.
